# Usability of code
 - Appropriate parameterisation, including defaults
 - A;l useful methods included
 -
# Development of original
 - original code only submitted as a .pde, making it difficult to actually view
 - Was already in a class, but constructor added
 - difficult to actually tell how much the scope has been extended, but you converted it from processing, which is good
# Quality of example
 -
# Quality of documentation

# Code Quality
